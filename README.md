# Double-Dragon-Reloaded-DC

This is an update of the excellent magggas Double Dragon Remake OpenBOR module, given the thumbs up by Magggas himself. :)

The goal of this update is to create an even more faithful representation of the Double Dragon franchise. The extra button devoted to back attacks will be phased out for Double Dragon’s traditional Punch, Kick, Jump controls. In its place is a Defense button as introduced by Return of Double Dragon for the SNES.

To represent the unique Double Dragon 2 style gameplay, and the divergence of Jimmy as the series progressed, Jimmy is being upgraded from palette swap to a fully realized character using the Double Dragon 2 style gameplay from Arcade and NES. Punch and Kick become Left and Right attack respectively. Additionally, Jimmy gains the immensely powerful special attacks from NES DDII.
At the same time, Billy gains some of the advanced command attacks from SNES Return of Double Dragon. The end result is Jimmy being a potent single strike character perfect for advanced players, while Billy is easy to handle and has more ways to break through enemy defenses. The latter advantage stems from enemies also receiving upgrades similar to SNES, where they too have countermeasures against certain attacks.

An emphasis on team moves and importing techniques introduced in later games is also being made, such as the team hurricane kick, vaulting jump kicks, and somersault throw.

Below is the progress made prior to GitHUB:

## General

- Just like World Hereos, a lot of stuff I forget to document before moing to GitHUB... *sigh*.

## Controls

- Back Kick button is removed. New button Defend replaces it.
- Punch and Kick are renamed “Attack A” and “Attack B” as their functions differ depending on which Lee brother is used.
